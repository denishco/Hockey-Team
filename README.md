# Hockey-Team

This program opens a file with a large amount of hockey players names and statistics and stores them all in an array.
The program then preforms multiple functions to do the following functions: build an array with the best team, build an array with all the players sorted, build an array with all players filtered by position.
The other functions are to: display the team statistics, calculate the points per team and to finally test all the functions
